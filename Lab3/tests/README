there are a few shell scripts provided   (*.sh):

test1.sh lets you run an individual inputfile against all algorithms
test2.sh will let you run all test input files on test1.sh

test3.sh will run like test2.sh but also provides for 10K and 1M inputs

test2a.sh and test3a.sh  will also provide the detail on the aging
algorithm for in18 and in60.

I will not provide more data for -opf for larger files .. 


Please use test2.sh if you downloaded the TestData.tar.bz2
or test3.sh if you downloaded the TestDataLarge.tar.bz2

Download into a directory 
cp *.sh to your directory and run appropriate test shell script.

then run ./diffit  <yourdir>  <mytestdatadir>
it will tell you which files are different.
Then you can work on those.
